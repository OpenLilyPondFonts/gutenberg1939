FONTLOG for the Gutenberg1939 font
==================================

This file provides detailed information on the Gutenberg1939 Font Software. This information should be distributed along with the Gutenberg1939 fonts and any derivative works.


Basic font information
----------------------
Gutenberg1939 is a typeface designed by Abraham Lee to mimic an old-fashioned metal-type style of music publishing. The glyph set comes from a facsimile found from "Buchgwerbliches Hilfsbuch" by Otto Sauberlich. This font software is not designed for use in a word-processing application, although all the glyphs may be accessed at their respective Unicode points. It was originally designed for use with LilyPond, the automatic music engraver.
